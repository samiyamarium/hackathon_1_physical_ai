This book provides a comprehensive exploration of the Humanoid Robot project, a cutting-edge initiative at the intersection of robotics and AI-assisted software development. It begins with an introduction to fundamental robotics, covering mechanical aspects, communication protocols for AI-robot interaction, and the AI core encompassing perception, planning, and action. The core of the book delves into the innovative development philosophy underpinning the project, detailed through its constitutional principles. These include Spec-Driven Development (SDD), Prompt History Records (PHR), Architectural Decision Records (ADR), the discipline of Small, Testable Changes, the rigorous Authoritative Source Mandate, and the strategic Human as Tool Strategy. Further chapters elaborate on project governance, the Agent's Execution Contract, and a culminating case study that demonstrates the integrated application of these principles in a real-world development cycle. This work serves as an essential guide for understanding the design, development, and governance of complex AI-driven robotic systems, offering insights into fostering transparency, traceability, and high-quality outcomes in advanced engineering projects.
